An example Flutter weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API.


Packages in use
[riverpod](https://pub.dev/packages/riverpod) for state management<br/>
[freezed](https://pub.dev/packages/freezed) for code generation<br/>
[http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) for talking to the REST API

[cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) for caching images

[mocktail](https://pub.dev/packages/mocktail) for testing

Note: to use the API you'll need to register an account on [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and obtain your own API key. This can be set inside lib/src/api/api_keys.dart.
